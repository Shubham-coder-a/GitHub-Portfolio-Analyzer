# 🎯 Problem Statement

Recruiters often evaluate candidates based on their GitHub presence.  
However, most developers don’t know:

- How strong their profile looks
- Whether their projects show impact
- If their pinned repositories are effective
- What needs improvement

This tool solves that problem by giving a clear, structured portfolio evaluation.
